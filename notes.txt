javascript--> synchronous
              single threaded
            this is default javascript behaviour

execution context  
    1 -> execute one line of code at a time
    2-> console log 1
    3 > console log 2 

    each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing


    blocking code -> block the flow of progam -> read file synchronous
    non-Blocking Code -> does not block execution -> read file async
